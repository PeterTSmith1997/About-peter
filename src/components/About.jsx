      <p className="text-gray-700">
        I am currently pursuing a PhD in computer science, with my research
        focused on enhancing online safety and protection for individuals. In
        addition to my academic work, I manage two companies that are dedicated
        to helping people establish an online presence while ensuring their
        digital security. My professional experience spans collaborations with a
        wide range of organizations, from large institutions such as the NHS to
        small, local websites. I am committed to delivering tailored solutions
        that meet clientsâ€™ needs on time, while maintaining a professional and
        approachable working relationship. A passionate advocate for universal
        internet access, my academic and professional pursuits are firmly rooted
        in ensuring that the online environment remains safe and secure for all
        users.
